After I was medically retired from the British Military due to a spinal injury, my Wife (who was born in Germany) and I decided to move to Germany with our son and dog in tow!  We found a beautiful house in NRW and have settled into village life. I have my work permit and residency in Germany and I am now looking for a job here, I would prefer WFH due to my injuries but I also enjoy traveling.

After a bumpy time (due to Brexit) I settled into life here and was looking at what my next career move would be and I saw an advert for the Digital Career Institute who taught (amongst others) Web Development so I applied.  I completed the 1 month assessment course and was then offered a full time place studying with them and began in July 2021. 

The course has been intense and interesting and I have learnt a "truck load" and I am under no illusion ,that I need to learn a lot more yet (whole life learning is something that i have always done!).  I am currently looking for a job in the IT industry and would love to chat if you feel that we would work well together.  

You can look at my CV or get in touch using the links at the bottom of the page.  I look forward to hearing from you!
